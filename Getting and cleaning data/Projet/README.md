# Getting and cleaning data course project

## Script analysis
- I downloaded data and i loaded the files using read.table function
- I exctract only the mean and std measurement from both train and test data
- I joined subject and activities to both train and test data using cband function
- Finally i merged test and train data and i created a tidy data by calculting the mean for each variable for each activity and each subject

## Project goal

- The submitted data set is tidy.
- The Github repo contains the required scripts.
- GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated.
- The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
